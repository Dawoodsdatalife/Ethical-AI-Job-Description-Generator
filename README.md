## üì¶ Requirements
Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create the `requirements.txt` file, use:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## üìÇ Dataset Format
Your dataset should be a CSV file containing at least the following columns:
- `Employed`: Target label (0 or 1).
- `Gender`: Protected attribute (`Man`, `Woman`, etc.).
- Additional columns: Categorical or numerical features.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### üîç Model Training (Standalone Script)
To train a model and save it as `trained_model.pkl`, run:
```bash
python Model_Training_File.py
```
You will be prompted to:
- Enter the path to your dataset.
- Choose a model from the following options:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Neural Network

### üåê Ethical AI Job Description Generator (Streamlit App)
To run the interactive Streamlit app, use:
```bash
streamlit run Ethical_AI_Job_Description_Generator.py
```
The app allows you to:
- üìÇ Upload your dataset.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Choose a model for training.
- üìä Evaluate the model's fairness using various metrics.
- üîç Visualize model explainability using SHAP plots.
- üíæ Download the trained model.

---

## üìä Fairness Metrics Evaluated
- **Disparate Impact**
- **Equal Opportunity Difference**
- **Statistical Parity Difference**
- **Average Odds Difference**

---

## üìå Output
- The trained model is saved as `trained_model.pkl`.
- The Streamlit app provides a downloadable model file.
